The results of the test indicate non-normality in these specific features based on the chosen statistical analysis or method used. The departure from normality implies that these variables do not conform to the characteristics expected under a standard normal distribution. This information is crucial for appropriately selecting statistical methods or models that account for the non-normal nature of these variables, ensuring robust and accurate analyses within the context of the dataset."
